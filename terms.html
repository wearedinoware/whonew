				<h1>Whonew Terms and Conditions of Service</h1>
				<p>Hi there! Welcome to Whonew's Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms"). We must impose rules on our users to protect our hard work. This is a contract between you and DinoWare Inc., and we want you to know yours and our rights before you use the Whonew application ("App"). Please take a few moments to read these Terms before enjoying the App, because once you access, view or use the App, you are going to be legally bound by these Terms (so probably best to read them first!).</p>

				<h2>1. Whonew Rules</h2>
				<p>Before you can use our App, you will need to register for an account ("Account"). In order to create an Account you must:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Be at least 18 years old</li>
					<li>Be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of your home country.
					You can create an Account via manual registration using your email. If you create an Account using your Facebook login details, you authorize us to access, display and use certain information from your Facebook account (e.g. profile pictures, relationship status, location and information about Facebook friends). For more information about what information we use and how we use it, please check out our Privacy Policy.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>We cannot condone you to use another person's Account without consent - that defeats the purpose of the whole app!</p>

				<p>You'll have a lot of fun on Whonew, but if you feel the need to leave, you can delete your Account at any time by going to the 'Settings' page when you are logged in and clicking on the 'Delete account' link. Your Account will be deleted immediately but it may take a little while for Your Content to be completely removed from the App. We will save your profile information in case you realise you miss us and you decide to restore your Account (which you can do within 30 days of de-activating your Account). DinoWare Inc. reserve the right at our sole discretion to terminate or suspend any Account, or make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the need to give you prior notice.</p>

				<p>You may not access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the App or our systems. Certain portions of the App may not be accessible if you have not registered for an Account.</p>

				<h2>2. Types of Content</h2>

				<p>There are three types of content that you will be able to access on the App:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Content that you upload and provide ("Your Content")</li>
					<li>Content that members provide ("Member Content")</li>
					<li>Content that DinoWare Inc. provide ("Our Content")</li>
				</ol>

				<p><strong>There is certain content we can't allow on Whonew.</strong></p>

				<p>We want our users to be able express themselves as much as possible on Whonew, but we have to impose restrictions on certain content which:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Contains language or imagery which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person</li>
					<li>Is obscene, pornographic, violent, or otherwise may offend human dignity</li>
					<li>Is abusive, insulting or threatening, discriminatory, or which promotes or encourages racism, sexism, hatred, or bigotry</li>
					<li>Encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence;
					is defamatory or libellous</li>
					<li>Relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers)</li>
					<li>Involves the transmission of "junk" mail or "spam"</li>
					<li>Contains any spyware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programmes or other malicious code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software, hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data or personal information whether from Whonew or otherwise</li>
					<li>Itself, or the posting of which, infringes any third party's rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights);</li>
					<li>Shows another person which was created or distributed without that person’s consent.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Whonew operates a zero-tolerance policy for this kind of content.</p>

				<h3>Your Content</h3>

				<p>Since Your Content is unique, you are responsible and liable for Your Content and will indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.</p>

				<p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you do choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances.</p>

				<p>Since Whonew is a public community, Your Content will instantly be visible to other users of the App all around the world  - so make sure you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. As such, you agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users and any person visiting, participating in or who is sent a link to the App (e.g. individuals who receive a link to a user’s profile or shared content from other Whonew Users). By uploading Your Content on Whonew, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights and licences to do so, and automatically grant us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use Your Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creative derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general publish such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).</p>

				<p>We may assign and/or sub-licence the above licence to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you.</p>

				<p>We have the right to remove, edit, limit or block access to any of Your Content at any time, and we have no obligation to display or review Your Content.</p>

				<h3>Member Content</h3>

				<p>Other Whonew members will also share content via the App. Member Content belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed via the App at the direction of the user providing the Member Content.</p>

				<p>You do not have any rights in relation to other users' Member Content, and you may only use other Whonew users' personal information to the extent that your use of it matches Whonew's purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your Account if you misuse other users' information.</p>

				<p>Member Content is subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 512(c) and/or 512(d) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998. If you have a complaint about Member Content, please see the Digital Millennium Copyright Act section below for more information.</p>

				<h3>Our Content</h3>

				<p>The rest of the Content on Whonew belongs to us. Any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, and other intellectual property appearing on Whonew are owned, controlled, or licensed by us and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property law rights. All right, title and interest in and to Our Content remains with us at all times.</p>

				<p>We grant you a non-exclusive, limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable, license to access and use Our Content, without the right to sublicense, under the following conditions:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>You shall not use, sell, modify, or distribute Our Content except as permitted by the functionality of the App.</li>
					<li>You shall not use our name in metatags, keywords and/or hidden text.</li>
					<li>You shall not create derivative works from Our Content or commercially exploit Our Content, in whole or in part, in any way.</li>
					<li>You shall use Our Content for lawful purposes only.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>We reserve all other rights.</p>

				<h2>3. Restrictions on the App</h2>

				<p>You agree to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Comply with all applicable laws, including without limitation, privacy laws, intellectual property laws, anti-spam laws, equal opportunity laws and regulatory requirements.</li>
					<li>Use your real name on your profile.</li>
					<li>Use an actual, current photo of yourself on your profile.</li>
					<li>Use the services in a professional manner.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Disclose information that you do not have the consent to disclose.</li>
					<li>Create or operate a pyramid scheme, fraud or other similar practice.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>We don't like users misbehaving in the Whonew community – users should not do bad things to other users. You can report any abuse or complain about Member Content by contacting us, outlining the abuse and/or complaint.</p>

				<p>We also don't appreciate users doing bad things to Whonew - we've worked hard on our App, so scraping or replicating any part of the App without our prior consent is expressly prohibited. This includes by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces - unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with us.</p>

				<h2>4. Privacy</h2>
				<p>For information about how DinoWare Inc. collects, uses, and shares your personal data, please read our <a href="https://whonew.app/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> – this is important stuff, and makes for great bedtime reading! By using Whonew, you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our <a href="https://whonew.app/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

				<h2>5. Third Party Stores</h2>
				<p>The App may be dependent on and/or interoperate with third-party owned and/or operated platforms and services, e.g., Apple (iTunes, etc.), Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. (each, a “Third Party Platform”) and may require that you be a registered member of such Third Party Platforms and provide certain account credentials and other information in order to access the App. By using the App, you agree to comply with any applicable terms, conditions or requirements promulgated by any provider of a Third Party Platform (e.g., Facebook’s Terms of Use, iTunes Store Terms of Use, etc.).</p>

				<h2>6. Push Notifications & Location-Based Features</h2>
				<p>We may provide you with emails, text messages, push notifications, alerts and other messages related to the App and/or the Whonew services, such as enhancements, offers, products, events, and other promotions. After downloading the App, you will be asked to accept or deny push notifications/alerts. If you deny, you will not receive any push notifications/alerts. If you accept, push notifications/alerts will be automatically sent to you. If you no longer wish to receive push notifications/alerts from the App, you may opt out by changing your notification settings on your mobile device.

				<p><strong>WARNING: If you disable push notifications, you will not be alerted about nearby matches, which is the entire point of the App.</strong></p>

				<p>With respect to other types of messaging or communications, such as emails, text messages, etc., you can unsubscribe or opt out by either following the specific instructions included in such communications.</p>

				<p>The App requires access to your location to perform its core function of finding matches. To make this possible, the App will determine your location using one or more reference points, such as GPS, Bluetooth and/or software within your mobile device. If you have set your mobile device to disable GPS, Bluetooth or other location determining software or do not authorize the App to access your location data, the App will not function properly. For more about how the App uses and retains your information, please read the <a href="https://whonew.app/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

				<p><strong>WARNING: If you disable or deny the App access to location services, you will not be receive nearby matches, which is the entire point of the App.</strong></p>

				<h3>Extra Legalities</h3>
				<p>If, for any reason, any of the Terms are declared illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from the Terms and the remainder of the Terms shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.</p>

				<p>No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under the Terms shall operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any variation of the Terms and nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise of the right or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.</p>
